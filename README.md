# 3D Group frontend tech test

This test consists of two parts: An express api, from where you will serve data, and a frontend from where you will consume the data served by the api.

Out of the 3 apps provided, you only need to complete 2 of them: The express api, and either the React or Vue frontend; the choice is yours.

In each app, you will find a README. Please read through this as it provides context and instructions on how to complete the task and what you must do once you have finished.

Good luck!
